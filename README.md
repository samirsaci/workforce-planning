### Getting Started
This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the Python script
uv run python workforce_planning.py

# Or launch Jupyter notebook
uv run jupyter notebook
```

### Dependencies
- pandas
- pulp
- matplotlib
- jupyter
